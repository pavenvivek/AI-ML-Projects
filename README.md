# Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Projects-
This repository contains AI/ML projects that use some classical, widely popular Neural Networks. Most of the code includes both TensorFlow and equivalent PyTorch versions. 

Anyone who wants to learn one framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch) while having knowledge of the other framework will find this repository helpful.
