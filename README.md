# AI/ML Projects
This repository contains AI/ML projects that use some classical, widely popular Neural Networks. Most of the code includes both TensorFlow and equivalent PyTorch versions. 

The projects will be helpful for beginners and anyone who wants to learn one framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch) while having knowledge of the other framework.
